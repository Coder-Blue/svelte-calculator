# What is this?

- This is my fun SvelteKit/Tauri calculator app, inspired by [Daniel Gorra's](https://www.youtube.com/@gorra1) video. Using skeleton template from:

```bash
bun create svelte@latest

#or
npm create svelte@latest
```

And

```bash
npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli@next

#or
bun add -D @tauri-apps/cli@next

#and
npx tauri dev

#or
bunx tauri dev
```

- Everything you need to know about a Svelte Project is this website [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/)
- And about the [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/)

## What does it have?

- A regular, plain looking calculator app.
- Svelte 5 Rune (Still in testing but it works so good on this project).
- TalwindCSS for styling the UI.
- Tauri V2 (Cross-platform/Memory Efficiency/Fast web app)
- Tauri Windows Vibrancy to give the users the native window's feeling.

## Cautious

- No SSR, just plain SPA.

## Developing

- Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn` or `bun install`), start a development server for Svelte web app:

```bash
npm run dev

# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src` folder and it's contents. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- Or you want to start a development server for Tauri app:

```bash
npm run tauri dev

# or
bun tauri dev
```

## Building

- To create a production version of your Svelte web app:

```bash
npm run build

#or
bun run build
```

- To create a production version of your Tauri app:

```bash
npm run tauri build

#or
bun run tauri build
```
